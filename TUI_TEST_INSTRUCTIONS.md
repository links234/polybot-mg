# TUI Test Instructions

## Fixed Issues ✅

The TUI application has been successfully debugged and fixed. Two main issues were resolved:

1. **"Device not configured" error**: The TUI was trying to run in non-interactive terminal environments
2. **"Cannot start a runtime from within a runtime" panic**: Async/await calls were causing runtime conflicts

### Key Fixes Applied:

1. **Terminal Detection**: Added proper detection of interactive terminals using `IsTerminal`
2. **Graceful Fallback**: Automatic fallback to CLI mode when TUI is not available  
3. **Async Runtime Fix**: Converted all UI rendering to synchronous to avoid nested runtime issues
4. **Robust Event Handling**: Used `try_read`/`try_write` for non-blocking access to shared state
5. **Better Error Messages**: Clear feedback when TUI can't run

## How to Test the TUI

### Option 1: Interactive Terminal (Recommended)
Run this in a real terminal (iTerm, Terminal.app, etc.):

```bash
# Test with a single asset
cargo run -- stream --assets 1343197538147866278486875265858153 --tui=true

# Test with markets file
cargo run -- stream --markets-path data/datasets/bitcoin_price_bets/2025-06-15/2025-06-15_19-48-01/markets.json --tui=true

# Test with debug logging
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run -- stream --assets 1343197538147866278486875265858153 --tui=true
```

### Option 2: Force CLI Mode
```bash
# Explicitly use CLI mode
cargo run -- stream --assets 1343197538147866278486875265858153 --tui=false --show-book

# CLI mode with markets file
cargo run -- stream --markets-path data/datasets/bitcoin_price_bets/2025-06-15/2025-06-15_19-48-01/markets.json --tui=false --show-book
```

## TUI Controls (when running in interactive terminal):

- **↑/↓**: Navigate through active tokens
- **Enter**: View detailed order book for selected token
- **Esc/Backspace**: Go back to overview screen
- **q**: Quit application
- **r**: Refresh stream if it gets stuck

## Expected Behavior:

### In Interactive Terminal:
- Shows TUI with real-time events and top 5 active tokens
- Can navigate and view order books
- Real-time updates of price changes

### In Non-Interactive Environment:
- Automatically detects terminal limitation
- Shows: "⚠️ TUI mode not available (no interactive terminal), switching to CLI mode"
- Falls back to CLI mode with colored output
- WebSocket streaming continues normally

## Troubleshooting:

1. **"TUI mode not available"**: This is expected in CI/Docker/background processes
2. **No events coming in**: The WebSocket is working, Polymarket may not have active trading on that asset
3. **Compilation warnings**: These are normal and don't affect functionality

The TUI is now robust and will work in any environment with appropriate fallbacks!
