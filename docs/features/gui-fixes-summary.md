# GUI Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Sidebar Black Bar When Market Streams Populate

**Fixed**: The sidebar no longer shows black bars when market streams start populating with data.

**Key Changes**:
- Added `ui.set_min_height(20.0)` to horizontal layouts to prevent collapse
- Used `ui.allocate_space(egui::vec2(0.0, 0.0))` after labels to prevent layout shifts
- Applied fixed-width formatting for numeric values:
  - `{:>3}` for stream counts (ensures 3-character width)
  - `{:>5.1}` for events per second (ensures 5-character width with 1 decimal)
- Made the loading state text match the populated state width to prevent resize

**Location**: `src/gui/app.rs` - Connection Management section (lines ~500-575)

### 2. Screenshot Functionality Implementation

**Fixed**: Screenshot button now properly captures and saves screenshots.

**Key Implementation**:
1. **State Management**:
   - Added `pending_screenshot: Option<(PathBuf, String)>` to track screenshot requests
   - Added `screenshot_message: Option<(String, Instant)>` for toast notifications

2. **Screenshot Flow**:
   - Button click triggers `ViewportCommand::Screenshot`
   - Screenshot is captured asynchronously
   - Event handler receives the image data via `egui::Event::Screenshot`
   - Image is saved using the `image` crate to `screenshots/` directory

3. **User Feedback**:
   - Toast notification appears for 3 seconds showing success/failure
   - Filename format: `screenshot_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.png`

**Dependencies Added**:
```toml
image = "0.25"
```

## Testing Instructions

### Testing Sidebar Fix
1. Run the GUI: `cargo run -- canvas`
2. Start streaming data (connect to WebSocket)
3. Observe the sidebar's Connection Management section
4. Verify no black bars appear as streams populate
5. The layout should remain stable as numbers update

### Testing Screenshot Feature
1. Run the GUI: `cargo run -- canvas`
2. Click the "ðŸ“· Screenshot" button in the sidebar
3. Check the `screenshots/` directory for the saved PNG file
4. Verify toast notification appears with success message
5. Screenshot should capture the entire application window

## Technical Details

### Sidebar Layout Fix
The issue was caused by dynamic content changing the layout dimensions when transitioning from "Loading..." to actual statistics. The fix ensures consistent space allocation regardless of content.

### Screenshot Implementation
Uses egui's event system for proper async screenshot handling:
- `ViewportCommand::Screenshot` triggers capture
- `egui::Event::Screenshot` delivers the image data
- `image::RgbaImage::from_raw()` converts and saves the data

Both fixes maintain the existing UI functionality while improving stability and adding new features.
