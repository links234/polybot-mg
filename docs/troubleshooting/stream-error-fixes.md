# Stream Command Error Display Fix

## Problem
The error "Error: No assets specified" was being displayed before the nice streaming header, making the user experience less polished.

## Solution
Updated the stream command to show the nice header first before any error messages:

1. **TUI Mode (`execute_tui_with_progress`)**:
   - Shows "🚀 Starting Polymarket WebSocket Stream" header immediately
   - Then attempts to load assets
   - If asset loading fails, shows error message after the header
   - Error handling is more graceful with proper formatting

2. **CLI Mode (`execute_cli`)**:
   - Also shows the header first via info! logging
   - Then attempts to load assets with proper error handling
   - Consistent behavior with TUI mode

3. **Cleaner Error Messages**:
   - Removed redundant error message in `show_available_selections_and_exit`
   - Removed extra newline in `run_interactive_dataset_selector`
   - Error messages now appear in a logical flow after the header

## Result
Users now see:
```
🚀 Starting Polymarket WebSocket Stream
═══════════════════════════════════════════
[Error messages if any]
```

Instead of:
```
Error: No assets specified
```

This provides a more polished and professional user experience.
