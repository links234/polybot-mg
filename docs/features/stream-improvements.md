# Stream Command Improvements

## Overview

The stream command's dataset selection interface has been significantly improved with better organization, parallel loading, and enhanced user experience.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Hierarchical Dataset Organization**
- Datasets are now organized in a tree structure matching the filesystem
- Folders can be expanded/collapsed for better navigation
- Visual indicators show: `(selectable/total)` datasets in each folder
- Non-streamable datasets (like pipeline metadata) are clearly marked

### 2. **Parallel Loading with Rayon**
- Dataset discovery now uses parallel processing
- Significantly faster loading for large dataset collections
- Added `rayon = "1.10"` and `walkdir = "2.5"` dependencies
- Background loading with progress indicators

### 3. **Enhanced Selection Features**
- **Bulk Selection**: Select all datasets in a folder with `a`
- **Global Selection**: Select all visible datasets with `A`
- **Smart Navigation**: Use arrow keys to navigate, Space to select
- **Quick Clear**: Press `n` to clear all selections
- **Folder Operations**: Use ‚Üê/‚Üí to collapse/expand folders

### 4. **Improved Keyboard Interface**
```
Navigation:
  ‚Üë/‚Üì         Navigate through items
  PgUp/PgDn   Fast scroll (10 items)
  ‚Üê/‚Üí         Collapse/Expand folders

Selection:
  Enter/Space Toggle selection on current item
  a           Select all items in current folder
  A           Select all visible items
  n           Clear all selections

Filtering:
  Type        Filter datasets by name/market
  /           Clear filter
  Backspace   Remove last filter character

Actions:
  s           Start streaming selected datasets
  ?/h         Show help
  q/Esc       Cancel and exit
```

### 5. **Visual Enhancements**
- **Dataset Type Icons**: üìÑ Market Data, üìä Analyzed, ‚ú® Enriched, üîß Pipeline, ‚≠ê Selections
- **Selection Indicators**: Clear checkboxes [‚úì] for selected, [ ] for unselected, [‚Äì] for non-streamable
- **Folder State**: ‚ñº expanded, ‚ñ∂ collapsed
- **Context-Aware Help**: Built-in help screen with all shortcuts

### 6. **Performance Optimizations**
- **Parallel Dataset Discovery**: Uses rayon for concurrent processing
- **Efficient Tree Structure**: Only processes visible items
- **Smart Filtering**: Expands folders when filtering to show matches
- **Lazy Loading**: Datasets are processed only when needed

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Launch improved dataset selector
cargo run -- stream

# Navigate and select datasets, then press 's' to start streaming
```

### Bulk Operations
1. Navigate to a folder containing multiple datasets
2. Press `a` to select all datasets in that folder
3. Press `s` to start streaming all selected datasets

### Filtering
1. Type part of a dataset name or market description
2. All matching datasets will be shown (folders auto-expand)
3. Press `/` to clear filter and return to tree view

## Technical Implementation

### New Files
- `src/tui/dataset_selector_v2.rs` - Improved dataset selector with hierarchical organization
- `docs/improved-dataset-selector.md` - Detailed documentation

### Modified Files
- `src/cli/commands/stream.rs` - Updated to use new selector
- `src/storage/discovery.rs` - Added parallel discovery method
- `src/tui/mod.rs` - Added new module exports
- `Cargo.toml` - Added rayon and walkdir dependencies

### Key Features
- **Folder Tree Structure**: Hierarchical organization matching filesystem
- **Parallel Processing**: Concurrent dataset discovery for performance
- **Smart Selection**: Bulk operations for folders and all visible items
- **Type Awareness**: Visual indicators for streamable vs non-streamable datasets
- **Enhanced UX**: Comprehensive keyboard shortcuts and help system

## Benefits

1. **Faster Loading**: Parallel processing significantly reduces wait time
2. **Better Organization**: Hierarchical view makes it easier to find datasets
3. **Bulk Operations**: Select entire folders at once instead of individual items
4. **Clear Visual Feedback**: Immediately see what can be streamed
5. **Enhanced Productivity**: Keyboard shortcuts for all common operations
6. **Scalability**: Handles large dataset collections efficiently

The improved dataset selector makes it much easier to work with large collections of datasets, provides better visual organization, and significantly improves the user experience when selecting datasets for streaming.
